//Constructor chaining - Parent constructor executes before childâ€™s.
//Variable hiding - Variables are resolved by reference type.
//Method overriding - Methods are resolved by actual object type (runtime).
//Upcasting - You can store a Developer object in an Employee reference, but can only access members available in Employee.
//Upcasting -  Storing a child object in a parent reference.


//Developer is a child of Employee, so before Java can construct the child, it must construct the parent first.

//When a child class object is created, the parent constructor always runs before the child constructor.
